# Modern Reinforcement Learning

I try to explain modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs) with clean code illustrated on simple examples. 

**Note:** 

1. The code is not optimized for performance, but for clarity.
2. The examples are not meant to be practical but rather to illustrate the concepts.

For the algorithms, I use a simple decoder-only Transformer as the policy model and a simple environment (FrozenLake) as the task. 
The files could in principle be quite easily adjusted for LLM reasoning tasks. i.e. to acquire reasoning capabilities.

## Algorithms

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

The PPO algorithm is implemented in the `ppo.py` file. 

### GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

To be implemented.
